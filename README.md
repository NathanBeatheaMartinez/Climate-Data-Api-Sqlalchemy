# sqlalchemy-challenge

A climate analysis about Honolulu, Hawaii.

Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

Python and SQLAlchemy script to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. Specifically, using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Part 2: Design A Climate App

After completing the initial analysis, I design a Flask API based on the queries that just developed. I then us flask to create the follwing routes: 

        /api/v1.0/precipitation
        /api/v1.0/stations
        /api/v1.0/tobs
        /api/v1.0/<start>
        api/v1.0/<start>/<end>
       
Try them out!
